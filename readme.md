The software that you should install/register:
1. FEMM - to run the thermal FE analysis
2. JMAG Express Online - to run thermal response for reference

The files provided should be placed in your PC (anywhere of your preference). The files and folders are:
1. The proposal "Proposal PMSM Thermal Model - Masters" - Read to understand the context of the project. Link: https://github.com/azrihizami/Bach.-Thesis---Angelina/blob/main/Proposal%20PMSM%20Thermal%20Model%20-%20Masters%20.pdf 
2. "PMSM_1.FEH" file. It is the geometry of your motor in FEMM for thermal analysis. Link to the file: https://github.com/azrihizami/Bach.-Thesis---Angelina/blob/main/PMSM_1.FEH
Download and open with FEMM.

Steps: (Watch video recordings: -)


A. LEARN TO USE FEMM FOR THERMAL ANALYSIS
1. Check out tutorial and try it: https://www.femm.info/wiki/HeatFlowTutorial
2. Show and explain the result of the tutorial to the SV

B. LEARN ABOUT THE THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MATERIAL IN A MOTOR
1. Read the proposal
2. Identify the materials involved in a motor. Do your literature review.
3. Identify the thermal characteristics of the materials. These includes thermal resistance and specific heat. Make a table of the materials, its thermal characteristics and the reference where you get their values

C. LEARN ABOUT HEAT TRANSFER MECHANISM IN MOTORS
1. Find information on what is the origin of the heat generated in a motor
2. Learn how does the heat transfer through the structure of the motor
3. Do a literature review on how the heat transfer in a motor can be modeled?

ONLY AFTER THESE 3 STEPS ARE DONE, WE WILL BE LEARNING HOW TO USE JMAG
